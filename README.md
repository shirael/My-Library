# My-Library

This project is a platform that allows users to submit their own endings to books missing the final chapter.
The author then selects the best ending from the submissions, and it becomes the official conclusion of the book. 
Additionally, users can leave comments on the books and endings.

# Development server

Run `dotnet run` to start the development server. Navigate to `http://localhost:5000/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

# Code scaffolding

# Build

Run `dotnet build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `bin/` directory.

# Running unit tests

Run `dotnet test` to execute the unit tests.

# Running end-to-end tests

Run `dotnet test` to execute the end-to-end tests. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities, such as Selenium or Playwright.
